Project Description:

The computer gaming industry remains one of the most dynamically evolving sectors globally. For the online store "Streamchik," operating in this competitive market, it is crucial to identify patterns that determine a game's success to develop effective product strategies and marketing campaigns. The available dataset includes historical sales data, user and critic ratings, genres, and platforms. This data will be used to build a model for assessing game potential.

Research Objective: Analyze the factors influencing video game success and identify patterns to forecast 2017 sales. The focus will be on examining relevant platforms, genres, reviews, and regional preferences.

Research Steps:

- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- User profiling by region
- Hypothesis testing

Key Insights:

The analysis will reveal critical success factors, including platform, genre, critic and user ratings, regional trends, and age ratings. Special attention will be given to identifying the most promising platforms and genres to shape an effective 2017 strategy. Statistical hypothesis testing will provide a data-driven foundation for managerial decisions.

Research Goals:

1. Identify platforms with stable or growing sales.
2. Analyze genre preferences across different global regions.
3. Assess the impact of user and critic reviews on sales performance.
4. Test hypotheses regarding differences in game reception across platforms and genres.
5. Provide actionable recommendations for game promotion and inventory planning.

The findings will enable Streamchik to better predict the success of new releases and optimize resource allocation for marketing and sales efforts.
